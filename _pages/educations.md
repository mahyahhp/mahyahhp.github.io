I have received my BSc degree in Aerospace Engineering from the best private university in Iran, SRBIAU, in 2010. I have completed my studies there with an overall mark of 77.95% which is equivalent to First-Class Honours. 

After finishing my BSc, I pursued my studies at a master level at the Sharif University of Technology which is the most well-known and outstanding federal university in Iran. Excellent rank in a national university entrance exam brings me successfully joining this exceptional university in Iran with awarding a full tuition fee waiver. I got my MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering – Aerodynamics with an overall mark of 90.9% (First-Class Honours) in 2013. It is an honour for me that my MSc thesis has been selected as the best annual aerodynamics thesis in Iran (2014). I also got a distinguished student award by ending up MSc studies.  

Successfully accepted in a national university entrance exam with a high rank, I started my PhD studies in Aerospace Engineering – Aerodynamics with granted a full tuition fee waiver again in 2014. I have got my degree with an overall mark of 95.25% at Sharif University of Technology as the top student bringing me a distinguished student award again (2019).
