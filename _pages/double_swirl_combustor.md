In this project, the effects of the air-fuel ratio <FONT FACE="Symbol">f</FONT> on the combustion features and emission of a dual swirler combustor have been studied. The fuel is **methane** that mixed with **air** that produces **O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and H<sub>2</sub>**. This is a real-world dual-fuel combustor. Grid generation for this complex geometry is done using [Gambit](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Fluent_FAQ#What_is_Gambit.3F) and [Ansys Fluent](https://www.ansys.com/en-gb/products/fluids/ansys-fluent) is used to do simulations. Turbulent flow is modelled using a **k-epsilon** method. Certain attention should be paid to capturing turbulence boundary layers consistency with the k-epsilon method to satisfy the required _**y<sup>+</sup>**_ condition in this method. The **species transport model** with a **one-step reaction mechanism** is utilized.
