Different cavitating fluid flow problems have been simulated using different CFD packages including **Ansys Fluent**, **Ansys CFX** and **OpenFOAM**. My studies show that for internal cavitating fluid flows the Ansys Fluent can provide accurate results, however, for external cavitating fluid flows Ansys CFX would be a better choice. OpenFOAM with the **interphaseChangeFoam** was also used to visualise external fluid flows that gave reasonable results.
